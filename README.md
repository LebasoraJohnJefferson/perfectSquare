# perfectSquare
1.) A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer multiplied by itself, such as 9, which is equal to 3 multiplied by 3.
2.) In a perfect square, the square root of the number will be a whole number, without any decimal or fractional part.
3.) The factors of a perfect square are always symmetric, meaning they occur in pairs, with each pair consisting of the same number multiplied by itself.
4.) The area of a square with sides of integer length represents a perfect square, as the length of each side multiplied by itself yields the total area of the square.
5.) Perfect squares have a distinct pattern in their last digit, with the last digit being either 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. For example, 16, 25, and 36 are perfect squares with the last digits 6, 5, and 6, respectively.
